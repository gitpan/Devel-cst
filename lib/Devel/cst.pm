=head1 NAME

Devel::cst - C stacktraces for GNU systems

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 perl -d:cst -e ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module sets signal handlers for C<SIGSEGV>, C<SIGBUS>, C<SIGILL>, C<SIGFPE>, C<SIGTRAP>, C<SIGABRT> and C<SIGQUIT> that prints a stacktrace and some more information about the fault to stderr before dying. This enables debugging even without gdb being present.
